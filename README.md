The repository contains the scripts used to measure the efficiency of color profiles in the encoding process.  
measurement.sh is the main script for the evaluation  
convert.py is used with Blender for the conversion between the profiles  
filter.py is used to process the measured data  
merge.py is used to merge the evaluated data into one file  
render.py is used with Blender for rendering of the dataset  
renderData.sh is used to render all scenes  
validate.sh is used to check the rendering process results
uvgMeasurement.sh is used to measure VVC on the UVG dataset
uvgConvert.py is used with Blender to convert UVG dataset to other profiles
